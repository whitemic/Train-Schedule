# Train-Scheduler

This project was the homework for week 7 of the Penn Coding Boot Camp.

# Application Details
This app was developed to be used by train administrators. The administrators are able to input train information - train name, destination, time of first train, and the frequency of the train arrivals. Once this information is submitted, a table is developed which provides information to viewers. Viewers are able to see the train name, destination, time of next train and the minutes until that next train arrives.

## Goal
To create a train scheduler website using JavaScript, and persisting information using Firebase.

## Functionality
The site consists of a form with input fields where information for a new train formation is entered. That information is then stored in the Firebase database and used to populate fields in a table showing the name of the train and when the next train will arrive. 

## Objective
To implement Firebase in order to persist data.
