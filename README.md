# Train-Schedule
This app was developed to be used by train administrators. The administrators are able to input train information - train name, destination, time of first train, and the frequency of the train arrivals. Once this information is submitted, a table is developed which provides information to viewers. Viewers are able to see the train name, destination, time of next train and the minutes until that next train arrives.
